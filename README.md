# Netflix Clone 

This project is a Netflix Clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the user interface of Netflix, including responsive design and interactive features. The goal of this project is to demonstrate frontend development skills by creating a clean, modern, and mobile-responsive layout similar to Netflix, offering a dynamic user experience.

## Features
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts seamlessly for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

Interactive Navigation: A stylish, animated navigation bar that remains fixed and interactive on hover.

Movie Sections: Movies and TV shows are displayed in horizontal rows, similar to Netflixâ€™s layout.

Hover Effects: Includes hover animations that scale up movie thumbnails and change color for headings.

Routing: Clicking on a movie poster redirects users back to the homepage (or could be expanded to display detailed movie information).
## Technologies used

HTML: For the structure of the web pages.

CSS: For styling the interface, including animations, hover effects, and responsive layout.

JavaScript: For interactivity, navigation, and dynamic content.
## Installation

git clone https://github.com/AdnanChouhan/Netflix.clone.git

## Future Improvements

Movie API Integration: Integrating TMDb API to fetch real movie data and display dynamic movie content.

Individual Movie Pages: Add pages that display detailed information about a movie when clicked.

Search Functionality: Implement a search feature to allow users to find specific movies.
